Klotz is a small wooden cube that prints informations on a LCD Color screen.

Thanks to two small invisible buttons hidded in the structure, you can switch between different mode such as :

	- Time (Time & Date, Countdown, Stopwatch)
	- Temperature (°C, °F)
	- Rotation angles (X, Y, Z)
	- Game
	- Menu

In the menu, you have access to some parameters such as :

	- Luminosity (8 Levels)
	- Sound (On / Off)
	- Screen rotation (On / Off)
	- Languages (Français, English, Deutsch)
	- Inverted colors (On / Off)

The cube is made of a 3D printed structure, packed in a wooden case.

Klotz is run by a Microchip PIC32 microcontroller, and carries a MPU-6050 gyroscope.

Softwares used to achieve the project :

	- MPLAB/Vim (Code and compilation)
	- Altium (Electrical schematics and PCB Design)
	- Blender (3D)
	- Illustrator/GIMP (all the pictures on klotz have been created by hand)

This project was made as a school project at 42 in a period of 6 months, from February 2017 to July 2017.

Grade : 130/100

Realized by :

	- Patrick Heutschi (Mechanics / Design)
	- Michael Heutschi (Code / Packaging construction / Beta testing)
	- Antoine Gouby (Lead / Hardware / Code)

Thanks to 42 and Gregoire (our teacher).
